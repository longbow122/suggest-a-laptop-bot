# SuggestALaptop Bot - A Discord Bot
This discord bot was written for [SuggestALaptop](https://discord.gg/r9R7T4Qg5A), and is used to aid those looking for a recommendation
in receiving a laptop recommendation. This bot also contains several other utility features for the SuggestALaptop discord server.
This bot was written in Java using [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA) to interact with Discord's API, along with [Spring](https://spring.io/) to allow
for better software development standards, along with implementing RESTful endpoints.

## Documentation
This project has not yet been documented, but once this bot has been developed to the point where it can be considered "complete",
detailed documentation and video documentation regarding the use and configuration of the bot will be released.

## Maintenance
This project is solely maintained by [longbow122](https://github.com/longbow122), but has been left as an open source repo
to invite comments on my work, and to allow for further maintenance of the bot by others should I not be able to continue
maintaining such a project.

## Releases
A new version of the bot will be released using Semantic Versioning (MajorUpdate.MajorFix.MinorFix) as soon as a potential 
change is made. Depending on the hosting solution used at the time, downtime of the bot along with some setup/maintenance time
might be needed.

## Contributions
### Pull Requests
Pull Requests will generally not be accepted, since I would prefer to maintain and work on changes to this project myself. 
If you strongly feel that your suggested change would be major work, and would strongly prefer to do it yourself through a pull request, then
this will be accepted, but will not be reviewed with priority over other PRs and issues.

I ask that you strenuously comment your code and explain why you've made such a change so that I can learn from your work, and why it is seen as 
an improvement over what is currently implemented.

It is worth noting that branches will follow a specific naming convention. Branch names are to be all lowercase, with hyphens
separating words where applicable. 

Depending on whether the branch is a minor change, major change, or a bug fix, that will also be prefixed to the branch name accordingly, with a forward slash.
See below for some examples:
```text
minor/implement-configuration
major/rework-data-model
patch/fix-bug-in-command-handler
```
When making a pull request, I ask that your branches be named so, where applicable.

### Issues
If you would like to suggest a feature, or would like to leave a more open-ended suggestion/feedback regarding my code 
and the implementation of the bot, [please open an issue](https://github.com/longbow122/suggest-a-laptop-bot/issues). I will do my best to respond to your issue as soon as I can.

### Comments/Feedback
General comments and feedback regarding the bot's features and usability are also welcome. You can either create an issue,
or leave a comment by contacting me through [Discord](https://discord.gg/r9R7T4Qg5A).
